## How it works ?

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.



### Installation Front-End ###

**1st:** Clone the repository at this URL : 
```
https://github.com/CyrilTrichereau/CyrilTrichereau_5_09022021
```

**2nd:** Install dependencies : from within the project folder, run `npm install`.

```
npm install
```

**3rd:** Then you can :

*Compile your code for development:*
```
npm run build:dev
```

*Compile your code for production:*
```
npm run build:prod
```

*Run the compiler server development:*
```
npm run server
```



### Installation Back-End ###

**1st:** Clone the repository at this URL : 
```
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5
```

**2nd:** Install dependencies : from within the project folder, run `npm install`.
```
npm install
```

**3rd:** You can then run the server with `node server`.
```
node server
``` 

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
